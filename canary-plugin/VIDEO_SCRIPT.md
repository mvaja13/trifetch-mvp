## EMAIL TO SEND WITH VIDEO:

**Subject:** "Your API + 48 Hours = This 🚀"

**Body:**
```
Hi [CEO Name],

I spent the last 48 hours building something I think you'll find interesting.

I took your vocal biomarker API documentation and built a production-ready
corporate wellbeing platform around it. (Video attached)

What you're seeing:
✅ Real-time WebSocket processing
✅ Full data persistence
✅ Historical analytics
✅ Audio visualization
✅ PDF reporting

This is a working demo that shows exactly how your technology can integrate
into enterprise HR systems.

I built this as part of a trial for Trifetch, but I wanted you to see what's
possible with Canary Speech's platform.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Best,
Gautam

P.S. - The entire codebase is production-ready. Next.js, TypeScript, real-time
architecture. Happy to walk you through the technical implementation.
```

## PRO TIPS FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT:

### 1. **Start STRONG**
- First 3 seconds determine if they keep watching
- Lead with the "48 hours" hook - it's impressive

### 2. **Show, Don't Tell**
- Let the UI speak for itself
- Smooth interactions > long explanations

### 3. **Emphasize Integration**
- Keep saying "your API" to make it personal
- Show how seamlessly it integrates

### 4. **End with Action**
- Make them want to reply
- Create curiosity about "what else is possible"

### 5. **Technical Credibility**
- Mention WebSocket, TypeScript, production-ready
- Shows you're serious, not just making a mockup
