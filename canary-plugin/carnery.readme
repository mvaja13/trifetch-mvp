# 🐦 Canary Wellbeing Insights

### AI-powered corporate wellbeing dashboard (demo MVP)

**Canary Wellbeing Insights** is a demo application built for a Trifetch product trial.
It showcases how Canary Speech’s vocal-biomarker technology can be extended into a new corporate use case:
**analyzing Zoom/Meet meeting audio to measure team stress, fatigue, cognitive load, and overall wellbeing.**

This MVP uses **mocked API responses** based on a realistic Canary Speech API spec.

## 🚀 Features

* 🎤 **Upload Meeting Audio** — simulate Zoom/Meet plugin capturing meeting voice
* 🤖 **Mock AI Analysis** — returns stress, fatigue, cognitive load, and sentiment scores
* 📊 **HR Dashboard** — view team stress trends, department comparison, and burnout risk
* 🔥 **Meeting Heatmap** — minute-by-minute stress levels
* 🛡 **Anonymous & Opt-In** — designed for ethical workplace use
* 🧪 **Realistic Mock API** — consistent with Canary Speech’s voice-analysis model structure

## 🧠 How It Works

```
[Upload Meeting Audio]
        ↓
[Mock Canary API]
        ↓
[Voice Biomarker Scores]
        ↓
[Dashboard: Stress • Fatigue • Cognitive Load • Sentiment]
```

The app **does not use real Canary Speech models** —
all responses are generated using mocked analysis data.

## 🧪 Mock API Specification Overview

### `POST /v1/analyses`

Uploads meeting audio → returns `analysis_id`.

### `GET /v1/analyses/{id}`

Returns biomarker scores:

* `stress_score`
* `fatigue_index`
* `cognitive_load`
* `meeting_sentiment`
* `timeline` (for heatmap)
* `burnout_risk`

You can find the full mock API spec inside the project at:
`/mock-api/README.md` or equivalent.
