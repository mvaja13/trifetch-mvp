This is a placeholder file for testing the audio upload feature.

In a real application, you would upload actual meeting audio files (.mp3, .wav, .m4a).

For this demo, you can upload ANY audio file or even this text file -
the mock API will generate synthetic analysis results regardless of the file type.

The application simulates the Canary Speech API processing and returns
realistic wellbeing metrics including:
- Stress scores
- Fatigue indices
- Cognitive load measurements
- Meeting sentiment
- Burnout risk assessments
- Minute-by-minute timeline data

Try it out by uploading this file or any audio file you have available!
