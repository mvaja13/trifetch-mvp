# Phase 6: Demo Notebook & Final Polish

## Goal

Create end-to-end demo notebook and prepare for video recording.

## Deliverables

1. `notebooks/demo_pipeline.ipynb` - complete runnable notebook
2. `demo_assets/storyboard.txt` - video script
3. `demo_assets/recording_instructions.txt` - how to record demo
4. Final README updates

## Tasks

- [ ] Create demo_pipeline.ipynb:
  - Section 1: Generate synthetic data
  - Section 2: Extract embeddings
  - Section 3: Train models
  - Section 4: Inference on test patient
  - Section 5: Visualize predictions with confidence bands
  - Section 6: What-if scenario comparison
  - All cells runnable top-to-bottom
- [ ] Write storyboard.txt (30-60s demo):
  - 0-5s: Title card
  - 5-15s: Show app with predicted curve
  - 15-30s: What-if slider demo
  - 30-45s: Quick pipeline diagram
  - 45-60s: CTA & Trifetch branding
- [ ] Write recording_instructions.txt:
  - How to record 5 audio clips (6-20s each)
  - How to capture stylus demo (tablet/mouse)
  - Screen recording settings for Streamlit app
- [ ] Update main README.md:
  - Add "Quick Start" section
  - Add architecture diagram (ASCII art)
  - Add example outputs/screenshots (as text descriptions)
  - Add license info

## Technical Specs

- **Storyboard**: Scene-by-scene breakdown with timestamps

## Success Criteria

- Notebook runs end-to-end in <5 minutes on Colab
- All plots display correctly
- Storyboard is clear enough to guide video recording
- Recording instructions are actionable for non-technical user
- README is polished and professional
