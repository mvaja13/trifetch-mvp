│                                                                         │
│  This is our AI-powered system for predicting cognitive decline        │
│  in Alzheimer's patients.                                              │
│                                                                         │
│  The app shows historical cognitive scores as blue dots, and our       │
│  model predicts future scores up to twenty-four months ahead,          │
│  shown in orange with confidence intervals.                            │
│                                                                         │
│  This patient is currently at eighty-eight points. Our prediction      │
│  shows a gradual decline over the next two years.                      │
│                                                                         │
│  Now, let's explore a what-if scenario. What if this patient           │
│  improves their sleep by two hours per night?                          │
│                                                                         │
│  Watch as the prediction curve shifts upward. The model shows          │
│  the patient could maintain two to three points higher scores          │
│  with this simple intervention.                                        │
│                                                                         │
│  Let's also increase physical activity by twenty percent.              │
│                                                                         │
│  The combined interventions show even more improvement.                │
│  The gray line shows the baseline, and the green line shows            │
│  the healthier trajectory.                                             │
│                                                                         │
│  The impact analysis shows the patient could gain over three           │
│  points at the twenty-four month mark through these lifestyle          │
│  changes.                                                              │
│                                                                         │
│  This system helps healthcare providers have data-driven               │
│  conversations with patients about the real impact of their            │
│  daily choices.                                                        │
│                                                                         │
│  Ready for clinical deployment. Built by Trifetch.                     │
