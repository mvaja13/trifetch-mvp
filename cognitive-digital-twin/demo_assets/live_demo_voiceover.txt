FULL SCRIPT (Copy this into ElevenLabs)
===============================================================================

This is our AI-powered system for predicting cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients.

[pause]

The app shows historical cognitive scores as blue dots, and our model predicts future scores up to twenty-four months ahead, shown in orange with confidence intervals.

[pause]

This patient is currently at eighty-eight points. Our prediction shows a gradual decline over the next two years.

[pause]

Now, let's explore a what-if scenario. What if this patient improves their sleep by two hours per night?

[pause]

Watch as the prediction curve shifts upward. The model shows the patient could maintain two to three points higher scores with this simple intervention.

[pause]

Let's also increase physical activity by twenty percent.

[pause]

The combined interventions show even more improvement. The gray line shows the baseline, and the green line shows the healthier trajectory.

[pause]

The impact analysis shows the patient could gain over three points at the twenty-four month mark through these lifestyle changes.

[pause]

This system helps healthcare providers have data-driven conversations with patients about the real impact of their daily choices.

[pause]

Ready for clinical deployment. Built by Trifetch.

[8-18s] "The app shows historical cognitive scores..."
ACTION: Hover mouse over the plot
        Point to blue dots (historical)
        Point to orange line (predictions)
        Point to shaded area (confidence)

[18-24s] "This patient is currently at eighty-eight points..."
ACTION: Show the patient info in sidebar
        Keep plot visible

[24-30s] "Now, let's explore a what-if scenario..."

        Move from 0 to +2 hours

[30-38s] "Watch as the prediction curve shifts upward..."
ACTION: Let the plot update
        Pause to show the change
        Gray baseline appears

[38-44s] "Let's also increase physical activity..."
ACTION: Move activity slider slowly
        Move from 0 to +20%

[44-50s] "The combined interventions show even more improvement..."
ACTION: Let plot fully update
        Show both interventions active
        Point to green line vs gray baseline

[50-56s] "The impact analysis shows..."
ACTION: Scroll down to impact metrics
        Show the +3 points improvement

[56-60s] "This system helps healthcare providers..."
ACTION: Scroll back up to show full interface

ELEVENLABS SETTINGS
===============================================================================

Voice: Adam (professional, clear)
Stability: 50%
Clarity: 75%
Speed: 0.95x (slightly slower for demo pacing)

Alternative voices:
- Bella (professional female)

===============================================================================
PRACTICE TIPS
===============================================================================

1. Generate the voiceover first
2. Play it while practicing mouse movements
3. Time your actions to match the voice
4. Practice 2-3 times before recording
5. Record screen + voiceover together

TIMING TRICK: Add [pause] markers where you need more time
              ElevenLabs will add natural pauses


===============================================================================
RECORDING SETUP
===============================================================================

BEFORE YOU START:
1. Launch Streamlit app: streamlit run src/app.py
2. Select patient P005 (good example patient)
3. Reset all sliders to 0
4. Set browser zoom to 150% (for readability)
5. Hide desktop icons/notifications

RECORDING:
1. Start playing voiceover MP3
2. Immediately start screen recording
3. Follow actions in sync with voice
4. Don't stop if you make small mistake
5. Can edit out pauses later

SOFTWARE:
- macOS: QuickTime (Cmd+Shift+5, select screen + mic)
- Windows: OBS Studio (free) or Xbox Game Bar (Win+G)
- Set audio source: "System Audio" + voiceover playing


===============================================================================
SIMPLIFIED VERSION (30 seconds)

If you want a shorter demo, use this:

---
This is our cognitive decline prediction system.

The blue dots show historical scores, and the orange line predicts twenty-four months ahead.

Watch what happens when we improve sleep and increase physical activity.

The prediction shifts upward, showing the patient could gain three points through these simple lifestyle changes.

Data-driven healthcare, ready for clinical use.

Solution: In ElevenLabs, set Speed to 0.85x or 0.9x

Problem: Actions don't match timing
Solution: Add more [pause] markers in the script

Problem: Plot doesn't update in time
Solution: Move sliders slower, or add pauses in script

Problem: Can't sync voice with screen recording
Solution: Record screen first, add voiceover in editing
